# --- Core Deep Learning & NLP (Stage 1: Intent Router) ---
# PyTorch is recommended as the backend for the transformer model
torch
transformers
datasets

# --- Data Handling & Utilities ---
# Pandas is used for initial data cleaning and manipulation (Step 1.2)
# scikit-learn is needed for basic metrics/evaluation on the test set (Step 4.1)
pandas
scikit-learn

# --- Response Handler & Task Execution (Stage 2) ---
# 'requests' is for external API calls, e.g., OpenWeatherMap (Step 3.1)
requests

# --- User Interface & Deployment ---
# 'streamlit' is required for the final presentation UI (Step 4.2)
streamlit

# --- LLM Integration (Small Talk/Generation) ---
# Required if you choose to use Hugging Face's inference client for Dolly2/LLaMA2
# Note: You may need a specific library here depending on the FINAL LLM choice (e.g., openai, llama-cpp-python, or simple requests)
# We will use 'requests' for now, but a dedicated library may be added later.
